##### **Dataset**
A rare but fatal disease of genetic origin occurring chiefly in infants and children is under investigation. An experiment was conducted on a 100 couples who are both carriers of the disease and have 5 children. A researcher recorded the number of children having the disease for each couple.

```{r src, comment=NA, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(knitr)

## Dataset
(dta = data.frame(
  Diseased = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  Count = c(21, 42, 24, 8, 4, 1)
))

## Number of diseased children (d) and the total number of children (c)
(d = sum(apply(X = dta, MARGIN = 1, FUN = function(p) dta$Diseased * dta$Count)[,1])); (c = 5 * sum(dta$Count))

## MLE
(mle = d / c)

## Calculate the expected probabilities and expected diseased children
dta$Exp.Prob = round(dbinom(x = 0:5, size = 5, prob = mle), 4)
dta$Exp.Diseased = with(dta, sum(Count) * Exp.Prob)

dta

## Chi-square test requirements:
##  1) all Exp must be > 1
##  2) at most 20% of Exp may be less than 5
##
## So we need to combine counts 4 and 5 and meet these requirements

dta[5, 2:4] = dta[5, 2:4] + dta[6, 2:4]
dta = dta[-6, ]
dta$Diseased = as.character(dta$Diseased)
dta$Diseased[5] = '4 or 5'

## Compute the Chi-Squared Statistic
dta$X.2 = round(with(dta, (Count - Exp.Diseased)^2 / Exp.Diseased), 4)
dta$Diseased = factor(dta$Diseased)
dta

## Compute the test statistic pvalue
(TS = sum(dta$X.2)); 1 - pchisq(TS, df = 4)

## Based on the table below we conclude the binomial model is a good fit for the data
##
## Assessment of Chi-squared GOF P-value
##  •       p-value > .25 ⇒ Excellent fit
##  • .15 ≤ p−value < .25 ⇒ Good fit
##  • .05 ≤ p−value < .15 ⇒ Moderately Good fit
##  • .01 ≤ p−value < .05 ⇒ Poor fit
##  •       p-value < .01 ⇒ Unacceptable fit
##
## Plot of the data vs model and create a markdown table from the data frame
plot(x = dta$Diseased, y = NULL, xlab = "Diseased Children per Couple", 
     ylim = c(0, 50), ylab = "Frequency", 
     axes = FALSE, type = "n", main = "Binomial Model vs Data")
axis(1, labels = dta$Diseased, at = dta$Diseased)
axis(2, labels = seq(0, 50, 10), at = seq(0, 50, 10))
legend("topright", c("Data", "Model"), col = c("blue", "red"), pch = 19, bty = "n")
points(x = dta$Diseased, y = dta$Count, col = "blue", pch = 19, type = "b")
points(x = dta$Diseased, y = dta$Exp.Diseased, col = "red", pch = 19, type = "b")

kable(dta)

## Some Conclusions
## Since N is large we can use asymptotic confidence intervals
## A 95% confidence interval for whether a child will have the disease
mle + c(-1, 1) * 1.96 * sqrt(.27 * (1 - .27))/sqrt(100)

## What is the probability that a couple will have at least 1 child with the disease?
1 - pbinom(q = 0, size = 5, prob = .27)
