## **Hypothesis Testing**

---

##### **Techniques Used**
  * Shapiro Wilks Normality Test
  * T-Test
  * Calculating Power
  * Hypothesis Testing

---


```{r a1, comment=NA, fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
## QQ plot for normal distribution
set.seed(10)
x1 = rnorm(20)

## Are the data from a normal distribution?
shapiro.test(x1)     ## Shapiro-Wilk Tes

mean(x1)

```


---

How does the sample mean compare to a hypothesis test that the tru mean is 0?
$$H_0: \mu = 0, H_a: \mu \ne 0$$

|             | $H_0$ is True |  $H_a$ is True  |
|:-----------:|:-------------:|:--------------:|
|Accept $H_0$ |    Correct    |  Type II Error |
|Accept $H_a$ | Type I Error  |   Correct      |


```{r a3, comment=NA, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## Is the true mean equal to 0?
t.test(x1)
## What is the power of our test?
power.t.test(n = length(x1), delta = mean(x1), sd = sd(x1), sig.level = .05, 
             type = "one.sample", alternative = "two.sided", strict = T)

```



```{r a4, comment=NA, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
x1 = rnorm(200)
## What is the power of our test?
power.t.test(n = length(x1), delta = .05, sd = 1, sig.level = .05, 
             type = "one.sample", alternative = "two.sided", strict = TRUE)


```
